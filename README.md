- KISS Philosophy (_Keep It Simple_)

- Rss and Atom feeds
- Download feed images (and convert them to folder.jpg for compatibility)
- Designed for Linux but should run on any platform

**To be done:**
- Complete podcast tags from feed (artist, album ...)
- Make a plugin to update the MPD playlists with the downloaded podcasts
